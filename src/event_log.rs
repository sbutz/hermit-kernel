//! Per-core log of kernel events, printed on shutdown.
//!
//! The log only collects raw events with their time, a timestamp of the processor
//! (see `get_timestamp`). Latencies are derived from it afterwards:
//!
//! - The lateness of a timer interrupt is the time from the deadline of the latest
//!   [`Event::TimerArm`] of a core to its [`Event::TimerInterrupt`]. A task is only
//!   woken up once the current time is greater than its deadline. If the handler runs
//!   within the microsecond of the deadline, the timer is armed again with the same
//!   deadline and fires immediately.
//! - The delivery latency of an IPI is the time from the latest [`Event::IpiSend`]
//!   to a core to its [`Event::IpiReceive`]. It includes the cost of sending the IPI.
